    // Limitation of Array
    // 1. Size is fixed
    // 2. Contigous memory needs to be allocated
    // 3. Insertion and Deletion of elements is difficult because we need to shift the data elements

    // Linked List: Linear Data Structure
    // It is flexible dynamic ds in which elements form a sequential list.
    // Every element is called a "Node".
    // Every node has data and pointer to the next element.
    // Tail node points to NULL
    // Insertion and deletion is easy as there is no need to shift the elements.

    // Limitations :
    // 1. Requires more memory space
    // 2. Slow Search Operations.
    // 3. Reverse Traversal is not possible.

    // Doubly Linked List :

    return 0;
